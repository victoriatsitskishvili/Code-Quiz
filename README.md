# Code-Quiz
1. HTML:
- adding a title - Code-Quiz
- adding a reference to a css document  - using rel
- creating a css document under assets css folder (empty for now)
- Need to create different div classes - Scores, Timer, Wrapper (basically a div that will have all the rest of the HTML of the document)
- For a highscore section, we need to connect a new html file where the scores will be saved (a href)
- Creating an inline element for a div class timer (span)
- Under the Wrapper class, we are creating 3 main div ids - screenstart, questions and screenend
- For the Screenstart div, by looking at the mock-up provided, we can notice Title (which we will use h1 for) - Coding Quiz Challange; some text under (we will use p) - Try to answer the following code-related questions within the time limit. Keep in mind that incorrect answers will penalize your score/time by ten seconds!; and the button (create a button, using id to style after) - Start Quiz! 
- Create a new divs for questions and answers
- Create a new div Screenend, by looking at the mock-up provided, we can notice Title (which we will use h2 for) - All done!; some text (we will use p element) - Your final score is (need to use a span id); some tex (we will use p element) - Enter initials:; input type - text (default value); and the button (create a button, using id to style after) - Submit
-  Creating a new div (rightwrong) to give the feedback on the answer 
- Creating 2 empty js files to link to the html (Point to an external JavaScript file - script src)

2. Css
- Adding a font style and size to a body elements
- Adding a style to an a element (hyperlink), as well as a color to a hover
- Styling a button with display function - allows to set a width and height on the element where the top and bottom margins/paddings are respected, does not add a line-break after the element
- Adding an existing hover style to a button
- Adding a display style to an answer button - displayed as a block
- Setting the font size to input - input[type=text] - will only select text fields
- Styling an ordered list - padding, hight, overflow auto - If content fits inside the padding box, it looks the same as visible, but still establishes a new block formatting context. Desktop browsers provide scrollbars if content overflows.
- Using a list syle 
- Adding style to each class
